# Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## main branch

## Release 0.3.1 (2025-03-06)

* Added `TreeMatcher::write_to_path()` and `TreeMatcher::write_to_out_dir()` for
  convenience. This reduces boilerplate needed in build scripts.

## Release 0.3.0 (2024-06-18)

Once again, this release was cut to ensure generated code passes lints.

### Breaking changes

* Changed `TreeMatcher::new()` to accept `std::fmt::Display` instead of
  `AsRef<str>`, since we convert to a `String` with `to_string()` regardless.
  This is very unlikely to break anything.
* Changed `TreeNode::render_iter()` to accept `std::fmt::Display` instead of
  `AsRef<str>`, since we use the parameters in format strings. This is very
  unlikely to break anything.

### Changes

* Switched [code to disable Clippy][disable_clippy] to use `cfg(clippy)` instead
  of `cfg(feature = "cargo-clippy")`. The [feature has been deprecated].

[feature has been deprecated]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/02/28/Clippy-deprecating-feature-cargo-clippy.html

## Release 0.2.0 (2023-05-26)

This release is primarily aimed at ensuring generated code passes lints.

### Breaking changes

* Renamed `TreeMatcher::set_input_type()` to `TreeMatcher::input_type()`.

### Changes

* Made sure generated functions pass [Clippy]â€™s [pedantic lint group]:
  * Changed to add [`#[must_use]`][must_use] to generated functions by default.
  * Added trivial documentation about what errors are returned by a few
    functions.
  * Disabled [`clippy::single_match_else`] lint within generated match
    functions, since we sometimes generate `match` statements with a single arm.
  * Disabled [`clippy::too_many_lines`] lint within generated match
    functions, since such functions can be extremely long.
* Added support for setting documentation on generated functions. This also adds
  docs to the stub function used in disabled Clippy mode which allows it to be
  used with [`#![warn(missing_docs)]`][missing_docs].
